The purpose of this repository is to expand on a local project idea to provide hotspot to public areas.  Focusing on carrying out the project all alone will be difficult individually, but allowing the creating of a repository with a sample HTML splash page design and splash page instructions will help others expand on this project as well as inform users of a hotspot how they can contribute.
